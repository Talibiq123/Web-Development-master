// closures: Closures in JavaScript refer to the ability of a function to "remember" the variables and their values from the outer
// (enclosing) scope even after that function has finished executing. This allows the function to maintain access to those variables and
// manipulate them, enabling powerful patterns like data encapsulation and creating functions with persistent state.
// closures: 30-40%
// analyse: 70-80%
// real example: 100%

// function can return function
